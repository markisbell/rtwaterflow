"""Tests for the process leak guard helper (``rtwaterflow.proc_guard``).

The helper backs the session-scoped pytest leak guard and the
``rtwaterflow.main`` startup preflight. These tests spawn a lightweight dummy
whose command line carries the ``rtwaterflow.main`` marker (but which never runs
the real server / binds a port), confirm the helper detects it, and confirm it
disappears after the process tree is killed — so the guard neither misses a
leak nor false-flags a cleaned-up process.
