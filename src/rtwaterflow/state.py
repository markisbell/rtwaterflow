"""StateStore — latest frame, bounded history, WS fan-out, strict projection (SPEC §6).

Blueprint ``state.py`` verbatim port (§9.1): the store holds the latest
:class:`~rtwaterflow.simulator.StepResult` plus a bounded history deque, keeps
the WebSocket subscriber set, and owns the **one** ``asdict()`` + projection
path that REST ``/state``, ``/history``, every WS frame, and (from M6) the
recorder sink all go through — one code path, never parallel ones (SPEC §1).

Strict mode (``RTWATERFLOW_EXPOSE_GROUND_TRUTH=false``): :meth:`_project`
strips the ground-truth keys (``_TRUTH_KEYS``) and blanks the free-text
``error`` detail (solver internals are ground truth too); ``measurements`` /
``observed_summary`` — the operator view — always pass through.

Concurrency: everything runs on the engine's event loop; the only mutation
that needs a lock is the subscriber set (connect/disconnect race with
broadcast cleanup), hence a single ``asyncio.Lock`` for subscriber mutation
and nothing else (blueprint "no locks by design" for the physics path).
